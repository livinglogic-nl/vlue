# Version 1.0 MVP

Should showcase core strengths of Vlue:
- Fast startup
- Integrated puppeteer testing
- Integrated XHR mocking
- Demo project

## DOD
- The readme explains the following:
- Logo + short description of Vlue
- You can 'npm i -g vlue'
- Using 'vlue demo' you can create the demo project
- Entering the demo project you can do 'vlue' which starts a dev server and connects a chrome browser
- Changing a file in the /src directory hot reloads
- Puppeteer tests are automatically run in the background after 10 seconds idle.
- Renaming a it() to a fit() in a spec file runs that test in the foreground (and no longer the background stuff)
- Using 'vlue build' you can create a 'production' build:
    - A dist folder is created containing all the files to statically host in NginX

# Version 1.1
